# BreatheWatch
BreatheWatch, is a web application that helps New Yorkers make informed housing and lifestyle decisions by visualizing air quality data across the city. 

Using the NYC Open Data “Air Quality” dataset from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), the app highlights pollution levels and historical trends for key indicators like PM₂.₅ and Nitrogen Dioxide. 

Users can search for neighborhoods, compare air quality between locations, and explore an interactive heatmap showing pollution intensity across boroughs.

The goal of BreatheWatch is to make environmental health information easy to understand and accessible, empowering residents, renters, and homebuyers to recognize heavily polluted areas and choose cleaner, healthier places to live.
